# BugTracker
This application was built as part of a technical test

This is built in .NET Core MVC
The data is stored in Visual Studio SQL Server

To run the solution, simply open, build and run it.
This took approximately 3.5/4 hours to build.

To expose an API, I would have used Swagger but didn't have the chance to.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks.
